# Generalities

Here are some information that applies to all the documents.
All numbers are little endian â€“ high then low bytes
Number begining with "0x" are hexadecimals, others are decimals
Undetermined value is zero.

Here are some explanations about vocabulary used in this document.
OmaDataBase: is The OMGAUDIO folder. An OmaDatabase contains collections of tracks and tables.
OmaTable: is a file in OMGAUDIO folder (like 01TREE01.dat)
OmaClass: is a class in a file in OMGAUDIO folder (like GPFB in 03GINF01.dat)
OmaElement: is an element of a class.

## Variables
Name: Example Comment
title_id: 0x1B2 A unique number representing the title (also the name of the corresponding file in 10F0X folders, and also the place of the element describing the title in 04CNTINF file) 
max_titled_id:  The highest title_id currently in use.
title_key: 0x0002ca63 A unique number to identify a title. Used in 03GINFxx and 04CNTINF files. It is simply the number of milliseconds of the title (same value which is given in the EA3 tag of the file itsefl)
title_id_in_TPLBlist: 0x0004 Refers to the place of the title in list of title in TPLB classes (01TREEXX files)
artist_id: 0x0006 Identifiant of an artist in the file 03GINF02. This id refers to the place of the element in this file. 
artist_key: 0x00278e4a Identifiant of an artist called ARTIST. It's the sum of all the title_key which the artist of the titles is ARTIST. Used in 03GINFxx files.
album_id:
album_key: 0x00278e4a Same as artist_key for an album.
genre_id:
genre_key: 0x00278e4a Same as artist_key for a genre.
global_key: 0x033b7c44f It's the sum of all the key (= sum of all title_key = sum of all album_key = ...)
magik_key: 0x ff ff 03 90 da 10 To be studied. Present in files : 03GINF 04CNTINF .OMA
